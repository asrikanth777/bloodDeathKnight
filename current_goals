- Get access to Blizzard Developer account
- Look through API documentation
- Understand how to call that information

- Figure out how to structure program/ what to do first

November 18, 2024
- I have finished the POST request file and it gets information about the access token, more specifically it gives 
    + access_token : the token code
    + token_type : bearer
    + expires_in : 24hrs - 1 second
    + sub: client ID

- I could try just copy pasting what i get, but it would be cooler to automate it, so i parsing the response data for the access token and writing it into another file
- then accessing that file in the accessTOKEN.cpp file

November 19, 2024
- I wrote the code so that it parses through response and puts the access token into a textfile that can be parsed through by another program to pull character data
    + Now I just need to finish commentary and start figuring out how to parse respoinse in fetch character and pull data

- Now, we have to break down talents and item builds, cross analyze them with wowhead or icy veins, and look for differences in both builds

November 27, 2024
- Took a small gap to do other things and then came back to make sure what I did worked. All the code is currently working, but I have had to get rewritten responses by usikng the online API pull on Blizzard website.
- Now its just left to parse through IcyVeins or U.GG BIS build, but i dont know if they have api access so that will take awhile to figure out.
(they do not have api access, we might be cooked.....)

- I tried to make a python environment that uses Selenium, Chromium, and ChromeDriver. Didn't figure it out. AFTER  7 HOURS!!! Decided im going to do an unconventional route using C++ and a lil bit of javascript, using Node.js and Playwright. hopefully it works out. Good thing my mom knows JavaScript like the back of her hand so it won't be too bad, and Kotlin knowledge might help a little, but I am going to be doing a lot of reading.

- Trying to go through and learn JavaScript in this timeframe while also trying to learn C++ and Python is idiotic. So instead of rebuilding the talent tree in Wowhead guides, I am going to just parse for the export string for each build. It doesn't make much sense to try to recreate it and compare to my talents, if I would probably just use the export string anyways
- I have the html response from wowhead, now it is just parsing through, getting the export strings, titles for their respective builds, and putting it into a text file.

- Havent updated in a while, but I finished webscraping talent builds. The result isn't as pretty as I wanted but it works for what I need it for. Now it is just a matter of figuring out how to scrape for builds, since there is a good amount of diversity, i have also considered using u.gg, since they have a ranking for best gear
- this step is going to take longer to work out and my methods for achieving it will likely differ from the way I did it for talents.
- (might also be a good time to take a break and actually play the game more since i am not as high ranked as i used to be.......)

- Been a really long time since i updated this wow. I just finished the build response breakdown and have it saved as a textfile. wanted to make it into a json object right away but it became annoying to do so.
- next step is to read through text file and structure json file. what i was going to do is have it categorize by slot and then suggest the 1-2 items used that can be attained from raid, m+, crafting, etc.
- however, this project has kind of exhausted me. spent a lot of time and now i want to do some work on my columbia shuttle project before i let it collect dust. i will probably pick this back up when i get back from my india trip, but it isn't going to take a high priority like it did before.
- love doing this project, but i want to do something more aerospace oriented. i need to reinforce my understanding of orbital mechs, flight dynamics, the Kalman Filter and more. I also like python more ngl....
