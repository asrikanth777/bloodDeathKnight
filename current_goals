- Get access to Blizzard Developer account
- Look through API documentation
- Understand how to call that information

- Figure out how to structure program/ what to do first

- I have finished the POST request file and it gets information about the access token, more specifically it gives 
    + access_token : the token code
    + token_type : bearer
    + expires_in : 24hrs - 1 second
    + sub: client ID

- I could try just copy pasting what i get, but it would be cooler to automate it, so i parsing the response data for the access token and writing it into another file
- then accessing that file in the accessTOKEN.cpp file

November 19, 2024
- I wrote the code so that it parses through response and puts the access token into a textfile that can be parsed through by another program to pull character data
    + Now I just need to finish commentary and start figuring out how to parse respoinse in fetch character and pull data

- Now, we have to break down talents and item builds, cross analyze them with wowhead or icy veins, and look for differences in both builds

- Took a small gap to do other things and then came back to make sure what I did worked. All the code is currently working, but I have had to get rewritten responses by usikng the online API pull on Blizzard website.
- Now its just left to parse through IcyVeins or U.GG BIS build, but i dont know if they have api access so that will take awhile to figure out.
(they do not have api access, we might be cooked.....)
