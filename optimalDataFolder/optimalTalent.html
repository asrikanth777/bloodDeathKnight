enemies that do not spawn or despawn frequently and which can be loosely described as a multi-target boss. For this reason, since [spell=434260] does not split its accumulated damage between the targets it explodes on, in that specific situation, it can massively outperform any other build [b]if you are lucky[\/b].\r\n\r\n[center][cta-button guide=15695 hash=importing-and-exporting border=strong]How to Import Talent Loadouts[\/cta-button][\/center]\r\n\r\n[h2 toc=\"Raid Talent Builds\" type=bar][icon name=ability_marksmanship color=c6 inline=true size=medium type=round][\/icon] Best Blood Death Knight Raid Talent Builds[\/h2]\r\n[h3][icon name=achievement_boss_heraldvolazj color=c6 inline=true size=medium type=round][\/icon] Raid Single Target[\/h3]\r\n\r\nDespite a fundamental re-shaping of talents, both our class and specialization trees have actually been [i]reduced[\/i] in complexity and possible choices for The War Within.

This is one of the weird niches of 11.0.5 San'layn, as [spell=434260] is still mostly unsplit AoE. While there are no fights that justify it in Nerub-ar palace, a couple of the Blackrock Depths raid encounters may allow it to shine. As such, and for a break in the monotony, we are including it here.\r\n\r\n[pad]\r\n\r\n[center][dragonflight-talent-calc=blizzard\/CoPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAghxMzYMzMmZYGzMz0MMMzYGDAAAAAmZmZmZmZmNzMjBAAAzMzMAAAAGYgZMassAyyA2AYGsB][\/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h2 toc=\"Mythic+ Talent Build\" type=bar][icon name=inv_relics_hourglass color=c6 inline=true size=medium type=round][\/icon] Best Blood Death Knight Mythic+ Talent Builds[\/h2]\r\n\r\nMythic+ is where the talent refinements brought along with The War Within really shine. The removal, consolidation, and point reduction of various filler talents that were present in Dragonflight allows you to pick up new and interesting talents, both for utility and for throughput.\r\n\r\nYou have two utility choices to make:\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]Do you want to add [spell=108199] to your utility arsenal? While this may sound like a no-brainer, it is a costly point. It is also [b]one AoE stop[\/b] every 2 minutes when you already have [spell=207167], two charges of [spell=49576], and [spell=383269] running every 2 minutes alongside it. The question then becomes: [i]Do you need to stop [b]everything all at once[\/b] twice every 2 minutes?[\/i][\/li]\r\n[li]Do you need [spell=206970], whose value is extremely difficult to justify and whose cooldown reduction causes your AoE stops to be desynced from the rest of your team when routing on a 2 minute tempo? A 3 second silence sounds alluring and cool. A 3 second silence [b]on top of another AoE stop[\/b] is very often a waste of a silence, as it turns out. If so, you need to sacrifice a [i]lot[\/i] of things and pick up [spell=194679] purely for pathing purposes. Its use is still very much a loss, and is amplified by how [spell=221536] is basically mandatory in every build now[\/li]\r\n[\/ul]\r\n\r\n[spell=194844] now grants 25 seconds of cooldown reduction to [spell=49028], and this has severely constrained talent pathing due to its relative strength and the number of points to invest on that side of the tree.\r\n\r\n[pad]\r\n[tabs name=DungeonCouncil]\r\n[tab name=\"Default\" icon=sha_ability_warrior_bloodnova_nightmare]\r\n[dragonflight-talent-calc=blizzard\/CoPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAghxMzYMzMmZYGzMz0MMMzYGDAAAAAmZmZmZmZmNzMjBAAAzMzMAAAAjttBGwSwywEYYBgZwG]\r\n\r\n[\/tab]\r\n[tab name=\"Gorefiend's\" icon=ability_deathknight_aoedeathgrip]\r\n[dragonflight-talent-calc=blizzard\/CoPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAghZmZGjZmxMDzYmZmmhhZGzYAAAAAwMzMzMzMmNzMjBAAAzMzMAAAAjttBGwSwywEYYBgZwG]\r\n\r\n[\/tab]\r\n[tab name=\"GG Silence\" icon=spell_shadow_coneofsilence]\r\n[dragonflight-talent-calc=blizzard\/CoPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAghZmZGjZmxMDzYmZmmhhZGzYAAAAAwMzMzMzMmNzYMAAADzMzMAAAAjttBGwSwywEYYBgZwG]\r\n\r\n[\/tab]\r\n[\/tabs]\r\n\r\n[h2 toc=\"Delve Talent Build\" type=bar][icon name=inv_10_blacksmithing_consumable_key_color1 color=c6 inline=true size=medium type=round][\/icon] Best Blood Death Knight Delve Talent Builds[\/h2]\r\n\r\n[h3 toc=\"Main Delve Build\"][icon name=achievement_boss_heraldvolazj color=c6 inline=true size=medium type=round][\/icon] Delve[\/h3]\r\n\r\nThe Delve build is fundamentally the same as the Mythic+ build; we opted to keep all elements of mob control, and saw no reason to pick anything more. No enemy in Delve is scary enough on interrupts to justify a 12 second kick, and [spell=108199] has been wasted more often than not.\r\n\r\n\r\n[pad]\r\n[center]\r\n[dragonflight-talent-calc=blizzard\/CoPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAghxMzYMzMmZYGzMz0MMMzYGDAAAAAmZmZmZmZmNzMjBAAAzMzMAAAAjttBGwSwywEYYBgZwG]\r\n[\/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h4]About the Authors[\/h4]\r\n\r\nThis guide has been written by Panthea, who raids in [url=https:\/\/www.wowprogress.com\/guild\/eu\/tarren-mill\/Catalyst]Catalyst[\/url] (Tarren Mill-EU) and Mandl (Mandl#0001 on Discord).

For this reason, since <a href="/spell=434260/the-blood-is-life">The Blood is Life</a> does not split its accumulated damage between the targets it explodes on, in that specific situation, it can massively outperform any other build <b>if you are lucky</b>.<br /><br />How to Import Talent Loadouts<br /><br /><h2 class="heading-size-2"> Best Blood Death Knight Raid Talent Builds</h2><br /><h3 class="heading-size-3"> Raid Single Target</h3><br /><br />Despite a fundamental re-shaping of talents, both our class and specialization trees have actually been <i>reduced</i> in complexity and possible choices for The War Within. Specifically, <a href="/spell=108199/gorefiends-grasp">Gorefiend's Grasp</a> is now easily available, and almost every single utility point on the Blood tree is a matter of encounter design more than spec performance.<br /><br />We have opted to provide two builds - one for Deathbringer and one for San'layn - as encounters with forced melee downtime at the wrong time will cause San'layn to grossly underperform.<br /><br />]<br /><br />]<br /><br /><h3 class="heading-size-3"> Raid Cleave Build</h3><br /><br />Similarly to the single target build, we have provided both a Deathbringer and San'layn variant for raid cleave. This assumes there are no more than 8 targets around the time of every mark; if there are, switch to <a href="/spell=434905/grim-reaper">Grim Reaper</a> instead of <a href="/spell=440002/reaper-of-souls">Reaper of Souls</a>.<br /><br />]<br /><br />]<br /><br /><h3 class="heading-size-3"> Raid Council Build</h3><br /><br />A council fight consists of multiple stacked bosses that live for the entirety of the encounter without becoming immune or disappearing too often. This is one of the weird niches of 11.0.5 San'layn, as <a href="/spell=434260/the-blood-is-life">The Blood is Life</a> is still mostly unsplit AoE. While there are no fights that justify it in Nerub-ar palace, a couple of the Blackrock Depths raid encounters may allow it to shine. As such, and for a break in the monotony, we are including it here.<br /><br />]<br /><br /><h2 class="heading-size-2"> Best Blood Death Knight Mythic+ Talent Builds</h2><br /><br />Mythic+ is where the talent refinements brought along with The War Within really shine. The removal, consolidation, and point reduction of various filler talents that were present in Dragonflight allows you to pick up new and interesting talents, both for utility and for throughput.<br /><br />You have two utility choices to make:<br /><ul><li>Do you want to add <a href="/spell=108199/gorefiends-grasp">Gorefiend's Grasp</a> to your utility arsenal? While this may sound like a no-brainer, it is a costly point. It is also <b>one AoE stop</b> every 2 minutes when you already have <a href="/spell=207167/blinding-sleet">Blinding Sleet</a>, two charges of <a href="/spell=49576/death-grip">Death Grip</a>, and <a href="/spell=383269/abomination-limb">Abomination Limb</a> running every 2 minutes alongside it. The question then becomes: <i>Do you need to stop <b>everything all at once</b> twice every 2 minutes?</i></li><li>Do you need <a href="/spell=206970/tightening-grasp">Tightening Grasp</a>, whose value is extremely difficult to justify and whose cooldown reduction causes your AoE stops to be desynced from the rest of your team when routing on a 2 minute tempo? A 3 second silence sounds alluring and cool. A 3 second silence <b>on top of another AoE stop</b> is very often a waste of a silence, as it turns out. If so, you need to sacrifice a <i>lot</i> of things and pick up <a href="/spell=194679/rune-tap">Rune Tap</a> purely for pathing purposes. Its use is still very much a loss, and is amplified by how <a href="/spell=221536/heartbreaker">Heartbreaker</a> is basically mandatory in every build now</li></ul><br /><br /><a href="/spell=194844/bonestorm">Bonestorm</a> now grants 25 seconds of cooldown reduction to <a href="/spell=49028/dancing-rune-weapon">Dancing Rune Weapon</a>, and this has severely constrained talent pathing due to its relative strength and the number of points to invest on that side of the tree.<br /><br />]<br /><br />]<br /><br />]<br /><br /><h2 class="heading-size-2"> Best Blood Death Knight Delve Talent Builds</h2><br /><br /><h3 class="heading-size-3"> Delve</h3><br /><br />The Delve build is fundamentally the same as the Mythic+ build; we opted to keep all elements of mob control, and saw no reason to pick anything more. No enemy in Delve is scary enough on interrupts to justify a 12 second kick, and <a href="/spell=108199/gorefiends-grasp">Gorefiend's Grasp</a> has been wasted more often than not.<br /><br />]<br /><br />About the Authors<br /><br />This guide has been written by Panthea, who raids in <a href="https://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/tarren-mill/Catalyst" rel="nofollow">Catalyst</a> (Tarren Mill-EU) and Mandl (Mandl#0001 on Discord).

BDKs generally use AMS to cheese mechanics (not gaining certain debuffs or ignoring ground effects). The strength of the shield rarely matter in this usecase and the cooldown is often insignificant. Suggesting IBF to be ready more often is FAR better for a Tanking Class that benefits from Damage Reducing effects GREATLY, since its a self healing tank not a generally mitigating one. It's even beginner friendlier, because IBF has more usecases than AMS.[\/li]\r\n[li](Major) Relish in Blood. Incredibly insignificant talent inside a raid. Relish in Blood gives you 1 Runic Power per Second in a 100% Best Case Perfect Scenario. The heal is insignificant. Rather pick up Persaverence of the Ebon Blade, since it also goes off Crimson Scourge and increases Versatility with a somewhat 30-50% uptime. And every source of DR is much more valueable to a DK than anything else, since it's what they lack the most.[\/li]\r\n[li](Major) Coagulopathy whilst you can take this for a slight dps increase, it would still leave me baffled how someone would pick this over Blooddrinker. So I cant even believe that this is taken for it's dps increase but for some other unfathomable reason. - Perhaps it pays off in Add fights, but Adds are usually dead so quickly, that the DPS increase doesnt warrant the point over Blooddrinker.[\/li]\r\n[li](Unknown) Iron Heart. You advocate Mastery. I'm not so sure about it, but since I havent tried it yet, I wont critisize it too harshly. But generally a DK's issues are less about not having enough Healing\/Shielding but rather picking up Threat and getting oneshot (since DS ideally needs a buildup of 5 seconds, and with that your mastery build). Versatility is great for this! And since BDKs get 15% instead of only 5% free haste, we dont even feel like we're low on Haste anymore in the start of the addon.[\/li]\r\n[li](Unfathomable) Bloodshot. Even with a mastery build and all the shield you could build up, you won't find yourself in a position where you can keep your Bloodshield for more than 1 Hit against a threatening Boss, unless you outgear him or have a DR running. This talent is purely DPS focused for dumping double DS into a Boss because you're bored. But as BDK's isnt beginner friendly, I'd never suggest DPS focused Raidbuilds to a novice audience. But maybe I am in the wrong, where a Mastery Bloodshield build just always has a shield and you stroll through everything with ease.[\/li]\r\n[\/ul]\r\n\r\nNot mentioning Runetap in the guide also baffles me. It's such an incredibly useful tool for Progression. And every DR helps BDK immensly. It's not needed in every fight, but I would definetly include it into a standard template for Raiding. \r\nNot mentioning Blooddrinker is also very weird, as it serves so many purposes in the BDK arsenal for Single target. It deals amazing damage for its cost. It heals you a semi significant amount, but most importantly - it's a GREAT button to press when you're low on Runes and Runic Power. Since it somewhat heals you, and your character does something for 2 seconds that keeps him from dying.\r\n\r\nMythic+\r\n[ul]\r\n[li](Unfatomable) Permafrost. Regardless of how much Absorb synergy you want to get into this build, BDK white hits are 10% of its damage AT BEST. So in an Single Target fight, 20k for a geared DK. Do we really care about 800hps absorb for a Talent point? And you are picking this over Coldthirst, which gives more kicks, in an kick rich enviroment, which also gives 1\/3rd of a Deathstrike without needing a GCD? (I dont think I need to press how important any Runic Power is and how significant the use of each individual DS is when doing dangerous pulls.)[\/li]\r\n[li](Unfathomable) Bloodshot. Same as before, but worse. We don't deal significant Physical damage in AoE scenarios. At all. And our Bloodshield doesnt last, no matter how big your Mastery is, to sustain DnD + HS Spam to warrant this garbage. Singletarget damage here is also not an argument, since Tanks rather focus on AoE Damage, because they can shine there, to make up for their lack of singletarget damage, since DPS can specialize better on Singletarget than a Tank.[\/li]\r\n[li](Major) No Bonestorm. Bonestorm is risky to use for 1 Second when you activate it. Yes. But there is so much you can do to estimate when its okay to use, or how to make it okay to use. And the payoff afterwards is good damage and 10 seconds invincibility on larger pulls. Which means more time to build up RP, spam DnD HS and BB. Incredible not to take this. [\/li]\r\n[li](Minor) Bloodworm. Insignificant on Fortified. Useful tool in Tyranical. Worth mentioning to not take this on fortified. [\/li]\r\n[li](Unfathomable) Gorefiend's Grasp. Why ... would we ever... not take ... mass grip in M+? This is even more infuriating than Permafrost and Bloodshot combined. This is THE reason you want a BDK in M+. It increases damage. It increases control. It makes pulls smoother. It increases visibility of the situation. And it can even be a emergency interrupt. Like ... wow. You can argue about TIghtening Grasp if you really need the Talent point, but not taking Mass Grip is insanity.[\/li]\r\n[li](Major) Reinforced Bones. Passive Armor. More DR. DR is great. I dont see the need for Bloodtap when you have Heartbreaker and Tombstone. I really dont. Also we have more DRR than ever before, because we can actually take Tombstone now and make it worth while.[\/li]\r\n[li](Minor) I suggest Umbilicus Internitus instead of those garbage talents. At least you can have fun looking at a Giga Shield after each Vampiric Blood, because your Bloodplagues are boosted by 30-150% dmg. And this was a very fun feature to have in Legion too. VB makes you unkillable for 15 seconds and the shield after adds some 5-10 seconds ontop of this afterwards. Great. Fun. Better than garbage Bloodshot, Ironheart.[\/li]\r\n[li](Minor) Despite Mastery build, in M+ you have so many other sources of healing and staying alive. You dont need huge Bloodshields, that still die in 1-2 second because you have 10 most thrashing you. [\/li]\r\n[\/ul]\r\n---\r\nI pity anyone who fell for this trap of an build guide. Just focus on Damage Reductions and big Deathstrikes for Raids and Bloodplagues, RP generation and the several Cooldowns for M+.\r\nYoull do 50k+ dps on bigger pulls and be immortal with it, instead of wanking around with f***ing Bloodshot and Permafrost.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for thrashing this so offensively, but its quite offensive to look at this and believe beginners actually use this garbage.\r\nUse the unholy guide instead folks, that one actually has decent talents.","date":"2022-12-14T10:43:49-06:00","rating":-5,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"50k is quite low on big pulls as blood","creationdate":"2022-12-26T17:28:37-06:00","id":1586467,"rating":2,"commentid":5501524,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"cbiss527","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"Anti magic shell is far more useful as magic damage is the threat and physical generally isn't a problem","creationdate":"2022-12-30T16:22:04-06:00","id":1587900,"rating":2,"commentid":5501524,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"cbiss527","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false,"d4beta":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"I don't have many characters, but I believe your comment unintentionally misinforms the beginners you seek to aid.

(I dont think I need to press how important any Runic Power is and how significant the use of each individual DS is when doing dangerous pulls.)</li><li>(Unfathomable) Bloodshot. Same as before, but worse. We don't deal significant Physical damage in AoE scenarios. At all. And our Bloodshield doesnt last, no matter how big your Mastery is, to sustain DnD + HS Spam to warrant this garbage. Singletarget damage here is also not an argument, since Tanks rather focus on AoE Damage, because they can shine there, to make up for their lack of singletarget damage, since DPS can specialize better on Singletarget than a Tank.</li><li>(Major) No Bonestorm. Bonestorm is risky to use for 1 Second when you activate it. Yes. But there is so much you can do to estimate when its okay to use, or how to make it okay to use. And the payoff afterwards is good damage and 10 seconds invincibility on larger pulls. Which means more time to build up RP, spam DnD HS and BB. Incredible not to take this. </li><li>(Minor) Bloodworm. Insignificant on Fortified. Useful tool in Tyranical. Worth mentioning to not take this on fortified. </li><li>(Unfathomable) Gorefiend's Grasp. Why ... would we ever... not take ... mass grip in M+? This is even more infuriating than Permafrost and Bloodshot combined. This is THE reason you want a BDK in M+. It increases damage. It increases control. It makes pulls smoother. It increases visibility of the situation. And it can even be a emergency interrupt. Like ... wow. You can argue about TIghtening Grasp if you really need the Talent point, but not taking Mass Grip is insanity.</li><li>(Major) Reinforced Bones. Passive Armor. More DR. DR is great. I dont see the need for Bloodtap when you have Heartbreaker and Tombstone. I really dont. Also we have more DRR than ever before, because we can actually take Tombstone now and make it worth while.</li><li>(Minor) I suggest Umbilicus Internitus instead of those garbage talents. At least you can have fun looking at a Giga Shield after each Vampiric Blood, because your Bloodplagues are boosted by 30-150% dmg. And this was a very fun feature to have in Legion too. VB makes you unkillable for 15 seconds and the shield after adds some 5-10 seconds ontop of this afterwards. Great. Fun. Better than garbage Bloodshot, Ironheart.</li><li>(Minor) Despite Mastery build, in M+ you have so many other sources of healing and staying alive. You dont need huge Bloodshields, that still die in 1-2 second because you have 10 most thrashing you. </li></ul><br />---<br />I pity anyone who fell for this trap of an build guide. Just focus on Damage Reductions and big Deathstrikes for Raids and Bloodplagues, RP generation and the several Cooldowns for M+.<br />Youll do 50k+ dps on bigger pulls and be immortal with it, instead of wanking around with f***ing Bloodshot and Permafrost.<br /><br />I'm sorry for thrashing this so offensively, but its quite offensive to look at this and believe beginners actually use this garbage.<br />Use the unholy guide instead folks, that one actually has decent talents.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>elbardo</b></h3>A mythic + build without <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108199/gorefiends-grasp">Gorefiend's Grasp</a>?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JayDAxis</b></h3>Why are everyone these builds suggesting you take the very niche talent of <a href="/spell=454851/vestigial-shell">Vestigial Shell</a>? Almost anything would give more versatility then it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hustletron</b></h3>At this point in the expansion, 615 ilvl and KSM, I find really any talent that &quot;buffs&quot; blood shield or even augments it in either more shielding or duration is essentially wasted on any meaningful content because every mob hits for over 2 million anyway. <br /><br />Basically, umbillicus eternus is a waste, bloodshot is a waste, iron heart is a waste in my opinion unless you're doing trivial content where your shield will eat more than the damage you'd take but unfortunately any content that matters ie mythic, raiding, t8 to t11 delves, etc. the mobs hit too hard for you to get any value out of these talents. It almost feels like blood needs a rework already.<br /><br />Again just my opinion on how the class feels at this point in the expansion and unfortunately there's no real alternative to take at the respective tier levels.</div>
