You can use these currencies to upgrade items you obtain to their max potential (explained in [url guide=19615]this guide[\/url]). Due to the more powerful items requiring the limited currency of Crests on a weekly lockout, this means your decision making early on can be difficult. In general, you want to prioritize items you've obtained at the highest upgrade track you can obtain, with the following criteria to decide on the item:\r\n\r\n\r\n[ol]\r\n[li][b]Lowest Item Level Pieces[\/b] [toggler id=lowilvl hidden]Explanation [icon name=ui_profession_inscription size=small type=round color=c8 inline=true][\/icon][\/toggler]\r\n[div id=lowilvl hidden]\r\nFollowing key pieces, bringing up the item level of pieces you don't expect to get hold of at a higher item level in the near future to remove the Crest requirement is best.

You are strongly incentivized to try to fish for the highest possible item level weapon you can get (from Mythic+ or raid) in order to save yourself crests, and then upgrade either it, or a better weapon.\r\n[\/div][\/li]\r\n[\/ol]\r\n\r\n[h2 type=bar toc=\"Crafted Gear\"][icon name=inv_spark_whole_violet size=medium type=round inline=true color=c6][\/icon] Best Crafted Gear for Blood Death Knight[\/h2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h3 toc=\"Crafting Order\"][icon name=ui_profession_leatherworking type=round size=medium inline=true color=c6][\/icon][b][color=c6] Recommended Crafting Order [\/color][\/b][\/h3]\r\n\r\nWe [b]strongly[\/b] recommend waiting a tiny bit unless you [i]absolutely[\/i] want the immediate power gain, and have a Mythic crest to justify it irrespective of what embellishment you decide to craft with your [item=211296]. If you are not sure, or do not want to commit such a limited resource, you can craft 590 item level pieces with the same embellishments as you would on 636 crafted pieces.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that if, at any point, you're really struggling to pick up a [b]main-hand weapon[\/b] and you have a spare spark, that will always be the strongest immediate upgrade available. If you do, your only real choice is [item=222447 bonus=10222:1515] with [item=226030] or [item=226024]. Both have a ramp-up time, and their value relative to each other depends on both whether you can keep them stacked, and their respective item level.\r\n\r\nThe following early-season crafting paths may help you in choosing what to craft:\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li][toggler id=rwf_raider_with_weapon_need hidden]I am a super early raider and want an immediate power gain, but am not afraid to sacrifice this in the long run.

In vacuo, this means that you should prefer well-performing DPS players who also have even enough stat priorities to prefer ramping a bonus 0.6% total crit damage from their [item=213743] over just stacking a potentially better, unique gem color, while also realizing that this proc is [i]completely random[\/i] and disfavors specs with very high, infrequent, short burst.\r\n\r\nThis embellishment will gain in value as the season progresses and your bound ally gets more gem slots, but even at 4-stack value, it is still only 792 averaged stats per minute - and, fundamentally, none for you.\r\n[\/tab]\r\n[tab name=\"Dawnthread\/Duskthread Lining\" icon=inv_10_tailoring_embroiderythread_color1]\r\n[b][spell=457666]\/[spell=457677][\/b] functions in the following way:\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]The check for whether you are below 80% health is evaluated every 5.25 seconds while in a zone.[\/li]\r\n[li]The check for whether you are above 80% health is evaluated every ~1 second while in a zone.[\/li]\r\n[\/ul]\r\n\r\nAs a result, the value of this embellishment is much lower than just eyeballing how often you are above 80% because of the re-application and de-application lag on it. While both are slightly better than [spell=387335] was (which was a colossal failure for Blood as the Mastery it provided never amounted to anything other than a meager amount of bonus Attack Power on spells, due to how [spell=49998] functions), they are still underwhelming. This is particularly the case because their defensive value is rarely there when you need it, and cannot even be relied to be there if you are above 80%, unless you stay there for long.\r\n\r\nThese gain value in AoE in theory, if you naively assume their uptime does not go down in AoE.\r\n[\/tab]\r\n[tab name=\"Sanctified Steps\" icon=inv_plate_outdoorarathor_d_01_boot]\r\n[b][item=222458 bonus=10222:1515][\/b] - Does strictly less damage than other embellishments, is a 3 ilvl drop on a somewhat larger piece (boots), and the speed is a meme. The worst part of it is for Mythic+, where it will not be available for large pulls as it will trigger on off-tempo pulls on your route.\r\n[\/tab]\r\n[tab name=\"Elemental Focusing Lens\" icon=inv_plate_outdoorarathor_d_01_boot]\r\n[b][item=213770][\/b] - Currently the highest performing embellishment for Blood on any realistic target count. These, however, have a really important caveat: [b]This embellishment does [u]nothing[\/u] if you do not have a single Colored gem equipped[\/b].\r\n[\/tab]\r\n[tab name=\"DMD embellishments\" icon=inv_offhand_1h_dragonquest_b_01]\r\n[b][spell=453575]\/[spell=463610]\/[spell=454785]\/[spell=454857][\/b] are complicated in terms of value, and require an extensive explanation before the season starts. There are really good reasons [b]not[\/b] to craft them, and equally good reasons to craft them early as a very short-term gain.\r\n\r\nLet's cover the effects first, and which ones are good for Blood. If you absolutely must, you craft [spell=453575] or [spell=463610], as the other two are essentially useless for us. These can only be crafted on a weapon, and as a result, they're a very expensive craft in terms of total theoretical power: 3 ilvl on a weapon is a [i]very[\/i] consequential loss.\r\n\r\nThis is also where things get fun: It is only a loss if you have a 639 weapon, or if you could spend the crests on something more impactful. For people wanting to get a head start and waste no time doing so, this in turn means that crafting a 636 weapon with this right off the bat with your first spark allows you to completely rule out [i]any[\/i] further weapon drop outside of Vault or Mythic Nerub-ar palace. It is a fantastic, short-term-gain-for-long-term-loss gambling proposition, and will lead to people being extremely unhappy if [item=212388] shows up on week 2 in their vault (this is from the very first boss of Nerub-ar Palace, so the odds are higher than usual to see a weapon early). However, the gambling payoff is high, and higher than any weapon you can farm from non-weekly sources. \r\n[\/tab]\r\n[\/tabs]\r\n[\/box][\/wrapper]\r\n[pad][br][pad]\r\n\r\nYour [item=211296] items are required for crafting some of the most powerful The War Within equipment, so you should spend them wisely and aim to craft them at the highest possible item level. Note that you can always use the [url guide=18537]recrafting system[\/url] later down the line if you want to upgrade pieces, so there's no need to hoard them if there's something big you can get now. Much like early in Dragonflight, these are time-gated, with you receiving one every two weeks, and can be upgraded all the way to [b]Item Level 636[\/b].\r\n\r\nWhile there is a section below regarding [b]Embellishments[\/b], your [item=211296] crafts should aim to craft the highest impact item that's least likely to see a replacement from other sources due to their scarcity. You should use simulationcraft or raidbots to identify whether a specific Missive is significantly better than the rest.\r\n\r\n[pad]\r\n[h3 toc=\"Embellishments\"][icon name=inv_10_tailoring_silkrare_color1 color=c6 inline=true size=medium type=round][\/icon] Best Embellishments[\/h3]\r\n[pad]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current best option for Blood with an absolutely optimum gear setup is two copies of [item=213770]. All other embellishments fall off in content where damage taken is not a meme, or are strictly AoE pad options. The other closest choice, a weapon with [item=226024], is a 3 item level trade-off on the most impactful piece of gear you could have (your weapon), and is only a short-term gain if you did not yet get a Myth-track weapon from your Vault or Nerub-ar Palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\n[h4]About the Authors[\/h4]\r\n\r\nThis guide has been written by Panthea, who raids in [url=https:\/\/www.wowprogress.com\/guild\/eu\/tarren-mill\/Catalyst]Catalyst[\/url] (Tarren Mill-EU) and Mandl (Mandl#0001 on Discord).

As such, we will be following a simple priority: Maximizing <b>Strength</b> by deliberately equipping the highest possible item level items in all slots except trinkets, keeping a modicum of <b>Haste</b> in order to make sure to be able to land that third <a href="/spell=50842/blood-boil">Blood Boil</a> in <a href="/spell=439843/reapers-mark">Reaper's Mark</a>, and then prioritizing <b>Critical Strike, Versatility, and Mastery</b> after that.<br /><br />Even with this, we strongly recommend that you use <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear">Raidbots</a> to sim your own character and evaluate sidegrades with its Top Gear function. Just because this <i>exact gearset</i> is optimal does not necessarily mean that each individual piece on its own is the best in all circumstances.<br /><br /><h3 class="heading-size-3"> Overall Blood Death Knight Best in Slot Gear</h3><br /><br /><table><br /><tr><br /><td><b>Slot</b></td><br /><td><b>Item</b></td><br /><td><b>Source</b></td><br /></tr><br /><tr><td>Head</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/zone=14971/the-dawnbreaker">The Dawnbreaker</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Neck</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=223779/anubarash">Anub'arash</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Shoulders</td><td>]</td><td>Catalyst / Raid / Vault</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Cloak</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=224552/rashanan">Rasha'nan</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Chest</td><td>]</td><td>Catalyst / Raid / Vault</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Wrist</td><td>:10520]</td><td>Crafting</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Gloves</td><td>]</td><td>Catalyst / Raid / Vault</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Belt</td><td>:10520]</td><td>Crafting</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Legs</td><td>]</td><td>Catalyst / Raid / Vault</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Boots</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=223779/anubarash">Anub'arash</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Ring</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=219778/queen-ansurek">Queen Ansurek</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Ring</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/zone=12916/the-necrotic-wake">The Necrotic Wake</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Trinket</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/zone=15093/ara-kara-city-of-echoes">Ara-Kara, City of Echoes</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Trinket</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=219778/queen-ansurek">Queen Ansurek</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Weapon</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=223779/anubarash">Anub'arash</a></td></tr><br /><br /></table><br /><br /><table><br /><tr><br /><td><b>Slot</b></td><br /><td><b>Item</b></td><br /><td><b>Source</b></td><br /></tr><br /><tr><td>Head</td><td>]</td><td>Catalyst / Raid / Vault</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Neck</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=219853/sikran">Sikran</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Shoulders</td><td>]</td><td>Catalyst / Raid / Vault</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Cloak</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=224552/rashanan">Rasha'nan</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Chest</td><td>]</td><td>Catalyst / Raid / Vault</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Wrist</td><td>:10520]</td><td>Crafting</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Gloves</td><td>]</td><td>Catalyst / Raid / Vault</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Belt</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=218425/nexus-princess-kyveza">Nexus-Princess Ky'veza</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Legs</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=214502/the-bloodbound-horror">The Bloodbound Horror</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Boots</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=214502/the-bloodbound-horror">The Bloodbound Horror</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Ring</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=219778/queen-ansurek">Queen Ansurek</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Ring</td><td>:10520]</td><td>Crafted</td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Trinket</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/zone=15093/ara-kara-city-of-echoes">Ara-Kara, City of Echoes</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Trinket</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=219778/queen-ansurek">Queen Ansurek</a></td></tr><br /><br /><tr><td>Weapon</td><td>]</td><td><a href="/npc=223779/anubarash">Anub'arash</a></td></tr><br /><br /></table><br /><br /><style>.archon-logo-inline {

Unimaginative and very underpowered, to the point that with enough deaths, some Dragonflight trinkets are still technically on the menu.<br /><br />You can click on the notes icons next to each item for a rundown on the reasoning!<br /><br /><h3 class="heading-size-3"> Trinket Tier List</h3><br /><br /><table><br /><tr><td><b>Filter Trinkets By Drop Source</b></td></tr><br /><tr><br /><td><b>Raid</b></td><br /><td><b>Mythic+</b></td><br /><td><b>Delves</b></td><br /><td><b>Crafting</b></td><br /></tr></table><br /><table><br /><tr><td><br /><br />S<br /><br />A<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=212454/mad-queens-mandate?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=219314/ara-kara-sacbrood?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=219318/oppressive-orators-larynx?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=212453/skyterrors-corrosive-organ?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=212449/sikrans-endless-arsenal?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=219915/foul-behemoths-chelicera?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=215172/silken-chain-weaver?bonus=</a><br /><br />B<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=225638/spelunkers-waning-candle?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=212450/swarmlords-authority?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=219311/void-pactstone?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=178751/spare-meat-hook?bonus=</a><br /><br />C<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=219315/refracting-aggression-module?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=133300/mark-of-khardros?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=219300/skarmorak-shard?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=220305/ovinaxs-mercurial-egg?bonus=</a><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=221023/treacherous-transmitter?bonus=</a><br /><br /></td><br /><br /><td><br /><b>S Tier</b><br /><ul><li>No trinket can be considered above the cut to be S-tier.

You can use these currencies to upgrade items you obtain to their max potential (explained in this guide). Due to the more powerful items requiring the limited currency of Crests on a weekly lockout, this means your decision making early on can be difficult. In general, you want to prioritize items you've obtained at the highest upgrade track you can obtain, with the following criteria to decide on the item:<br /><br /><ol><li><b>Lowest Item Level Pieces</b> Explanation <br /><br />Following key pieces, bringing up the item level of pieces you don't expect to get hold of at a higher item level in the near future to remove the Crest requirement is best. Ideally you should do Helm, Chest and Legs first due to their stat budget, but after that go off sims.<br /></li><li><b>Main Hand Weapon</b>Explanation <br /><br />This is technically your biggest upgrade, but also your most expensive one. You are strongly incentivized to try to fish for the highest possible item level weapon you can get (from Mythic+ or raid) in order to save yourself crests, and then upgrade either it, or a better weapon.<br /></li></ol><br /><br /><h2 class="heading-size-2"> Best Crafted Gear for Blood Death Knight</h2><br /><br /><h3 class="heading-size-3"><b> Recommended Crafting Order </b></h3><br /><br />We <b>strongly</b> recommend waiting a tiny bit unless you <i>absolutely</i> want the immediate power gain, and have a Mythic crest to justify it irrespective of what embellishment you decide to craft with your <a href="/item=211296/spark-of-omens">Spark of Omens</a>. If you are not sure, or do not want to commit such a limited resource, you can craft 590 item level pieces with the same embellishments as you would on 636 crafted pieces.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that if, at any point, you're really struggling to pick up a <b>main-hand weapon</b> and you have a spare spark, that will always be the strongest immediate upgrade available. If you do, your only real choice is ] with <a href="/item=226030/darkmoon-sigil-symbiosis">Darkmoon Sigil: Symbiosis</a> or <a href="/item=226024/darkmoon-sigil-ascension">Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension</a>. Both have a ramp-up time, and their value relative to each other depends on both whether you can keep them stacked, and their respective item level.<br /><br />The following early-season crafting paths may help you in choosing what to craft:<br /><br /><ul><li>I am a super early raider and want an immediate power gain, but am not afraid to sacrifice this in the long run. I can afford to sacrifice my first Aspect crest weekly lockout for this purpose.<br />Craft the following:<br /><ol><li>Week 1: Craft ] with <a href="/item=226030/darkmoon-sigil-symbiosis">Darkmoon Sigil: Symbiosis</a> or <a href="/item=226024/darkmoon-sigil-ascension">Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension</a>, and <b>instantly</b> send all your Aspect crests into it.</li><li>Week 3: Craft <a href="/item=222431/everforged-greatbelt">Everforged Greatbelt</a> with <a href="/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens">Elemental Focusing Lens</a>. If by this point you do not have a socket on any of your gear, find one. Put a Colored gem into it (but not a diamond!).</li></ol></li><li>I have at least one Colored gem slot in my gear.<br />Craft the following:<br /><ol><li>Week 1: Craft <a href="/item=222431/everforged-greatbelt">Everforged Greatbelt</a> with <a href="/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens">Elemental Focusing Lens</a>. If, by this point, you do not have a socket on any of your gear, find one. Put a Colored gem into it (but not a diamond!).</li><li>Week 2: Craft <a href="/item=222435/everforged-vambraces">Everforged Vambraces</a> with <a href="/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens">Elemental Focusing Lens</a>.</li></ol></li></ul><br /><br /><b> Crafting Notes </b><br /><br /><b>]</b> is an effective no-value embellishment to you, which is already a very difficult bargain to take considering the conditions on it.<br /><br />Who you bind to is supremely important, as each <i>color</i> of a gem will increase the value that ally gets. In vacuo, this means that you should prefer well-performing DPS players who also have even enough stat priorities to prefer ramping a bonus 0.6% total crit damage from their <a href="/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite">Culminating Blasphemite</a> over just stacking a potentially better, unique gem color, while also realizing that this proc is <i>completely random</i> and disfavors specs with very high, infrequent, short burst.<br /><br />This embellishment will gain in value as the season progresses and your bound ally gets more gem slots, but even at 4-stack value, it is still only 792 averaged stats per minute - and, fundamentally, none for you.<br /><br /><b><a href="/spell=457666/dawnthread-lining">Dawnthread Lining</a>/<a href="/spell=457677/duskthread-lining">Duskthread Lining</a></b> functions in the following way:<br /><ul><li>The check for whether you are below 80% health is evaluated every 5.25 seconds while in a zone.</li><li>The check for whether you are above 80% health is evaluated every ~1 second while in a zone.</li></ul><br /><br />As a result, the value of this embellishment is much lower than just eyeballing how often you are above 80% because of the re-application and de-application lag on it. While both are slightly better than <a href="/spell=387335/blue-silken-lining">Blue Silken Lining</a> was (which was a colossal failure for Blood as the Mastery it provided never amounted to anything other than a meager amount of bonus Attack Power on spells, due to how <a href="/spell=49998/death-strike">Death Strike</a> functions), they are still underwhelming. This is particularly the case because their defensive value is rarely there when you need it, and cannot even be relied to be there if you are above 80%, unless you stay there for long.<br /><br />These gain value in AoE in theory, if you naively assume their uptime does not go down in AoE.<br /><br /><b>]</b> - Does strictly less damage than other embellishments, is a 3 ilvl drop on a somewhat larger piece (boots), and the speed is a meme. The worst part of it is for Mythic+, where it will not be available for large pulls as it will trigger on off-tempo pulls on your route.<br /><br /><b><a href="/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens">Elemental Focusing Lens</a></b> - Currently the highest performing embellishment for Blood on any realistic target count. These, however, have a really important caveat: <b>This embellishment does <u>nothing</u> if you do not have a single Colored gem equipped</b>.<br /><br /><b><a href="/spell=453575/ascendance">Ascendance</a>/<a href="/spell=463610/symbiosis">Symbiosis</a>/<a href="/spell=454785/radiance">Radiance</a>/<a href="/spell=454857/vivacity">Vivacity</a></b> are complicated in terms of value, and require an extensive explanation before the season starts. There are really good reasons <b>not</b> to craft them, and equally good reasons to craft them early as a very short-term gain.<br /><br />Let's cover the effects first, and which ones are good for Blood. If you absolutely must, you craft <a href="/spell=453575/ascendance">Ascendance</a> or <a href="/spell=463610/symbiosis">Symbiosis</a>, as the other two are essentially useless for us. These can only be crafted on a weapon, and as a result, they're a very expensive craft in terms of total theoretical power: 3 ilvl on a weapon is a <i>very</i> consequential loss.<br /><br />This is also where things get fun: It is only a loss if you have a 639 weapon, or if you could spend the crests on something more impactful. For people wanting to get a head start and waste no time doing so, this in turn means that crafting a 636 weapon with this right off the bat with your first spark allows you to completely rule out <i>any</i> further weapon drop outside of Vault or Mythic Nerub-ar palace. It is a fantastic, short-term-gain-for-long-term-loss gambling proposition, and will lead to people being extremely unhappy if <a href="/item=212388/ulgraxs-morsel-masher">Ulgrax's Morsel-Masher</a> shows up on week 2 in their vault (this is from the very first boss of Nerub-ar Palace, so the odds are higher than usual to see a weapon early). However, the gambling payoff is high, and higher than any weapon you can farm from non-weekly sources. <br /><br />Your <a href="/item=211296/spark-of-omens">Spark of Omens</a> items are required for crafting some of the most powerful The War Within equipment, so you should spend them wisely and aim to craft them at the highest possible item level. Note that you can always use the recrafting system later down the line if you want to upgrade pieces, so there's no need to hoard them if there's something big you can get now. Much like early in Dragonflight, these are time-gated, with you receiving one every two weeks, and can be upgraded all the way to <b>Item Level 636</b>.<br /><br />While there is a section below regarding <b>Embellishments</b>, your <a href="/item=211296/spark-of-omens">Spark of Omens</a> crafts should aim to craft the highest impact item that's least likely to see a replacement from other sources due to their scarcity. You should use simulationcraft or raidbots to identify whether a specific Missive is significantly better than the rest.<br /><br /><h3 class="heading-size-3"> Best Embellishments</h3><br /><br />The current best option for Blood with an absolutely optimum gear setup is two copies of <a href="/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens">Elemental Focusing Lens</a>. All other embellishments fall off in content where damage taken is not a meme, or are strictly AoE pad options. The other closest choice, a weapon with <a href="/item=226024/darkmoon-sigil-ascension">Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension</a>, is a 3 item level trade-off on the most impactful piece of gear you could have (your weapon), and is only a short-term gain if you did not yet get a Myth-track weapon from your Vault or Nerub-ar Palace.<br /><br />About the Authors<br /><br />This guide has been written by Panthea, who raids in <a href="https://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/tarren-mill/Catalyst" rel="nofollow">Catalyst</a> (Tarren Mill-EU) and Mandl (Mandl#0001 on Discord).
